# Github work flow, commands

# Developoment lifecycle :round_pushpin:

- git checkout -b feature_yourname || component_yourname

1. first when you start a new branch using following commands :pencil2:
2. name your branch by yourName/featureName
3.

```bash

git pull origin main
````

# React

We use React with JavascriptScript for our frontend codebase.

# Code Style Guide

We largely follow this react code style guidelines, [react syntax guidelines](https://github.com/pillarstudio/standards/blob/master/reactjs-guidelines.md), for creating components and file name.
